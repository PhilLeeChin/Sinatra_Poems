IF you didn't hear from me tomorrow, would you still love me?
<br><br>
IF a week past and you get news that I’m sick, would you still love me?
<br><br>
IF 2 months pass and still no news, would you pray to God for me to be ok?
<br><br>
IF a year pass and you hear I’m dead, would you pray to God that it's not true?
<br><br>
Would you love me every second of the day and pray to GOD to watch, guide, and protect me?
<br><br>
Time is going fast every day, pray for your family, loved ones, friends, even your enemies.
<br><br>
Place them in the hands of GOD. PUT JESUS IN CONTROL.
<br><br>
